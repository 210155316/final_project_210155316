Time Use Project Codebook: 

Variable                         Description 
---------------           -------------------------
Country                   The country of origin of the participants. 33 possible values:                  
                          Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
				  Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, 
				  Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, 
				  Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA, China, India, South Africa


Category                  Data from time-use diaries and questionnaires were sorted into 14 activity categories: 
                          Paid work, education, care for household  members,housework, shopping, other unpaid 
				  work & volunteering, sleep, eating & drinking, personal care, sports, attending events, 
			        seeing friends, TV & radio, other leisure 


Time                      The average time spent in a given activity category in total minutes. 
				  This was averaged from time-use diaries and questionnaires for participants from 
				  each country 


Hours 		        The average time spent in a given activity category converted to a decimal of an hour


Duration 		        The average time spent in a given activity category converted to hours & mins format 


Cumulative 			  The cumulative sum of hours - 0.5 x hours for that category. This was to define the 
				  annotation label position in the middle of each category bar

Percent 			  The percentage of total time spent in that activity category 



Data origins:
-------------

The data used in this project was sourced from 'Our World In Data' (https://ourworldindata.org/time-use), 
and was originally collected by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
an inter-governmental economic organisation.

Participants completed time-use diaries recording their sequence of activity during 24 hours, 
alongside specific questionnaires where respondents recalled the proportion of time spent in a specific 
activity category (information on the questions asked are not detailed in the original data). 


Paricipants were aged between 15-64. 


Functions:
----------
16 functions were created in this project due to the large amount of data wrangling required. 

FUNCTION_001 - deleting the residual rows after category combining, deleting rows containing "Shopping", "Attending events", 
			"TV and Radio", "Other leisure activities", "Housework", 
			"Other unpaid work & volunteering", "Paid work", "Care for household members "
		
FUNCTION_002 - creates a "duration" column which contains time spent in each category in seconds, hours and minutes 
FUNCTION_003 - creates an "hours" column containing time spent in each category as a decimal of an hour
FUNCTION_004 - deletes the seconds information from the "duration" column, leaving just hours and minutes information
FUNCTION_005 - deletes the unnecessary bracket from duration column 
FUNCTION_006 - filters out cells containing "minutes" from the duration column. This is then saved in a new data frame in the 
		   form country_mins
FUNCTION_007 - filtering out cells contianing "hours" from teh duration column. This is then saved in a new data frame in 
		   the form country_hours
FUNCTION_008 - deleting the word "hours" from duration column
FUNCTION_009 - converting duration column to numerical data 
FUNCTION_010 - calculating whole hours and residual minutes using "floor" and "round" and pasting these together in hours, mins format
FUNCTION_011 - combining the country_hours and country_mins data frames
FUNCTION_012 - shortening "minutes" to "m" in duration column
FUNCTION_013 - converting time column to numerical data 
FUNCTION_014 - sorting by alphabetical category
FUNCTION_015 -  defining label position in the middle of each bar using the following equation:(cumsum(df$hours) - df$hours/2). Saving 
		    this in a new column "duration"

FUNCTION_016 - calculates percentage of time spent in each category
